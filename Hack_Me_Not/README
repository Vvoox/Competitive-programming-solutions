This problem is consist of solving the min cost of removing cables , the way we need to calculate tha line and column of every number i,j in the matrix .
The idea is to take the min between the line and column of every i,j and put it in the new matrix 1  and out it , at the end we recognize this matrix is the min cost of all cables , and that's we need .
