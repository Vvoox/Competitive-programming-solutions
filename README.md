Medo and his friends were playing tawla in some downtown cafe. They invented a new dice with N faces.
Imagine a regular dice having six faces, instead this custom dice will have N faces, where each face will
have exactly one unique number from 1 to N. They made a game with only one rule. If someone throws
the dice and gets a number that is divisible by 6, they will win.
Given N, for a N faces dice, how many faces will lead to winning?
Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines will contain one
integer N (1  N  109).
Output
For each test case, print one line containing one integer, the answer required.
